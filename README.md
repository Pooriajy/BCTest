# BCTest
A simple proof-of-concept blockchain electronic ledger(a simple cryptocurrency).

# How to use
Note that the database is empty. you need to create the genesis transaction in the database and then start making transactions.
the server uses port 8080 to start its webserver, so be sure the port is not in use or use another port.
you can change the block difficulty in transactions.py, it is set on 4 which means it will use a combination of 4 digits or chars to create the proof for the block.
you can increase or decrease it, it will directly effect mining time.

$ This is just a simple project based on my little understanding of blockchain and cryptos!
